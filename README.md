# EverRAG: Unlock the Power of Your Own Knowledge with Effortless Insight

EverRAG transforms your Evernote into an intelligent, searchable database. If you’re a dedicated note-taker, you know the truth: most of those brilliant ideas, thoughts, and insights get buried over time, never to be seen again. With EverRAG, all those valuable notes come to life.

Imagine having the ability to:

* Ask Questions, Get Answers: Instantly tap into years of your own ideas and reflections. Need a summary, fresh insights, or a reminder of what you once thought? Just ask.
* Choose Your Own Model: Want to tailor your experience? Select from a range of open-source models to power your queries.
* Select Your Notebooks: Decide exactly which notebooks feed into your knowledge system for complete control over your insights.

With EverRAG, your ideas don’t just get stored—they become an active part of your thinking process, ready to fuel your next big breakthrough.

EverRAG is a self-RAG locally hosted plugged into your Evernote
